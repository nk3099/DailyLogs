# JWT Token Authentication:
-> the API doesn't track anything, ie. no info to be stored on API
-> Instead, the client holds on the token - and provides to us (via a Header of the request) to access any resource/endpoint (that requires user to be logged in)
-> API will validate if token is valid - thereby, API then sends backs the data.

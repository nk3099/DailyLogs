"""
UseCase of postResponse:
When we create a post, we want to return only the title, content, and published status of the post, not the id and created_at fields.
example: for now in get_request we get:
{
        "id": 1,
        "title": "first_post",
        "content": "welcome to first_post!",
        "published": true,
        "created_at": "2025-05-31T16:04:04.886711+05:30"
    },
so, want to limit the response to only title, content and published
and not include id and created_at
